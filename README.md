# A good old Pascal.

Yes, it's an old language since #TODO but it has been evolved to a bunch of different dialects. The two most popular ones are Delphi by Embarcadero and the open source FreePascal with the Lazarus IDE.

In this course I'll use the Embarcardero Delphi Community 12.1 but it should be backward and forward compatible with many versions of it plus Lazarus IDE.

The language is the compile to native binary, so it'll be easy to deploy to each supported OSes. 

## Change Log:

- Basic Hello World, Age Test
- Enable Skia to the projects
